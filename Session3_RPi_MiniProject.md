# 🎉 Session 3: Your First Physical Computing Project

**Theme:** _“Invent, build, and show off!”_

## Objectives:
- Apply what you’ve learned about GPIO input/output
- Create a mini project using buttons, LEDs, or buzzers
- Present your project to the group

## Suggested Projects:
1. **Reaction Timer**
   - LED lights up → press button as fast as possible
   - Use `time.time()` to measure speed

2. **LED Dice**
   - Press a button → blink LED a random number of times (1–6)

3. **Alarm System**
   - Pressing a “tripwire” button turns on LED/buzzer alert

4. **Mood Light Controller**
   - Cycle through LED patterns with button presses

## Session Plan:
### 1. Brainstorm Ideas (10 min)

### 2. Build Time (35 min)
- Wire up components
- Write and test your code

### 3. Project Showcase (15 min)
- Share your creation!
- Celebrate everyone's work

_This session is about creativity, problem solving, and having fun with tech!_
